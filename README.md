Portable C Compiler
===================

BSD licensed. Forked from IanHarvey/pcc, who saved a copy of the Portable C Compiler source code from http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/.

I created this fork because I want to build pcc for Windows, but pcc lacks a cmake build system. I've started work on creating a cmake build system using cmaker, but still have more to do before it will build. I haven't tried building using configure build system, but it is still here if you wish to give it a try.

Thank you to Jakub ≈Åukasiewicz, who made me think of pcc with his "C, the lingua franca of programming" website:
